Entity Relationship Diagram Acceptance Criteria Measurements The lessons and quizzes must always proceed in their intended order The quizzes must be intuitive to interact with for the user The quiz answers and results must not be vulnerable to modifications from non-administrative parties The answers submitted during quizzes must be evaluated within at most 0.5 seconds of submission. The Player\u2019s History must be updated with the results of the evaluated quizzes within 0.7 seconds of said evaluation No score in the History can be lower than 0% ER Tradeoffs The structure of each quiz is static in both its order and its content lieu of being randomized in both regards to ensure that the material cannot be memorized. We feel that this is acceptable because the lessons themselves are more concerned with getting people interested in both law and the school than serving as a fully educational format Failing a quiz forces a player to retake the lesson for the quiz instead of simply allowing them to retry the quiz. Lesson will be short and an option to speed up these sections can alleviate this issue, along with the fact that the order of and the content of the questions is static Communication Diagram Player's Web Interface State Diagram","title":"Lawyer-Up School of Law"},{"location":"#lawyer-up-school-of-law","text":"","title":"Lawyer-Up School of Law"},{"location":"#software-requirements-document","text":"Authors: Kenneth Devon Gaston & Gilberto Diaz","title":"Software Requirements Document"},{"location":"#table-of-contents","text":"Lawyer-Up School of Law Software Requirements Document Table Of Contents Introduction Acronyms Definitions Users Definitions Entities Definitions Technical Definitions Purpose Intended Audience Scope System Description Use Cases Use Case 1 - SME creating a lesson Use Case 2 - Marketing personnel evaluating a lesson Use Case 3 - Player creating an account Use Case 4 - Player taking a quiz (Fully Dressed) Entity Relationship Diagram Acceptance Criteria Measurements ER Tradeoffs Communication Diagram Player's Web Interface State Diagram","title":"Table Of Contents"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#acronyms","text":"Subject Matter Expert (SME) Phoenix Wright Game (PWG) Lawyer-Up School of Law (LSL) Content Management System (CMS) Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER)","title":"Acronyms"},{"location":"#definitions","text":"","title":"Definitions"},{"location":"#users-definitions","text":"SME - SME or Subject Matter Experts are attorneys, law experts, professors in law, or any matter expert in the field of law and en employee of the LSL.
