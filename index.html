<h2 id="system-description">System Description</h2>
<p>The Phoenix Wright Game tries to attract people that might be interested in a Law career. The game has lessons that are focused on real-world cases that are retrieved from the Pacer system. Lessons have a series of quizzes or challenges ranked by difficulty and each quiz is composed of multiple choice questions. Lessons are ranked by difficulty as well. The player needs a score of 70% or greater to move to the next quiz. The player can move on to the next level once he finishes all quizzes in the current level.</p>
<p>Once a player finishes a quiz, the quiz's score and user's profile information will be available to the Marketing team for them to assess. After performing a marketing analysis on the data, the Marketing team starts sending marketing material to all the players and potentially sending personalized letters to those carefully selected.</p>
